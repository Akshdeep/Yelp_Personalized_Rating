# Yelp_Personalized_Rating
Yelp is a platform where users can view information about businesses and rate and review the businesses they visited. Users view the ratings and reviews by other users before choosing to visit a business (in particular, restaurants). e current rating system on Yelp does not consider any personalized information about the users and the review text, and just gives the average rating to the user. So each user sees the same rating regardless of their tastes and preferences. Due to this, if the user visits a restaurant with high rating, but it may not be according to the taste of the user, the user may have a bad experience and think that the restaurant is overrated. Or if a user visits a restaurant with low rating, but it is according to the taste of the user, the user may have a good experience and think that the restaurant is underrated. e objective of this project is to construct a sophisticated model that provides personalized star ratings of the restaurants based on features such as similarity among dierent users, their taste, similarity among different restaurants etc. In this project we experiment with the hybrid model and compare it with the non-hybrid models.
